# String Calculator Kata

This kata is designed to help you learn test-first coding and refactoring. To that end, try not to read ahead or guess what the next requirements might be. Work incrementally, and complete as many steps as you can in a 30 minute period. Continue trying the kata from scratch, until you can complete it entirely within 30 minutes.

# Steps

# Commit 1 - Accept a string of 0, 1 or 2 numbers. Produce an exception if more than 2 numbers. Return the sum of the numbers, or return 0 for empty string.

# Commit 2 - Amend to allow an unknown number of numbers in the input string.

# Commit 3 - Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (as well as commas).

# Commit 4 - remove bin folders

# Commit 5 - Allow the Add method to handle a different delimiter

# Commit 6 - Include functionality for negatives not allowed

# Commit 7 - Do not include numbers greater than 1000 in the returned sum

# Commit 8 - Delimiters can be any length
