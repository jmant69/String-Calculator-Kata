# String Calculator Kata

This kata is designed to help you learn test-first coding and refactoring. To that end, try not to read ahead or guess what the next requirements might be. Work incrementally, and complete as many steps as you can in a 30 minute period. Continue trying the kata from scratch, until you can complete it entirely within 30 minutes.

# Steps

# Commit 1 - Accept a string of 0, 1 or 2 numbers. Produce an exception if more than 2 numbers. Return the sum of the numbers or 0 for empty string.
